# About me
I am currently a Scientific Researcher at the **Center for Socio-Ecological Studies and Global Change** of the **[Humboldt Institute](https://www.humboldt.org.co/)** in Colombia. With a Master's degree in Electronics Engineering and a Doctorate degree in Life Sciences, I am dedicated to develop smart tools for biodiversity conservation, particularly in tropical ecosystems. My expertise spans signal processing, machine learning, acoustics, and ecology. Over the past decade, my research has focused on developing innovative tools for quantitatively analyzing ecosystems through the lens of acoustics. This work involves proactive engagement with ecologists, sociologists and local communities to ensure the conservation of biodiversity while accommodating the developmental needs of socio-ecological systems.

## Projects
* Machine listening to monitor climate change impacts on neotropical amphibians (2022-2023). Develop a cloud-based machine learning system to screen passive acoustic recordings and identify neotropical amphibian species. Funded by GEO-Microsoft Planetary Computer Programme. Role: Principal Investigator. See [GEO 2023 Report](https://earthobservations.org/storage/app/media/documents/Events/GEO-Week-2023/GEO%202023%20Highlights%20Report.pdf), page 41.
* ¿How does my city sound? Soundscapes from your window. (2020-2021).Community Science Initiative Launched Amid COVID-19 to Study Urbanization's Impact on Soundscape. Funded by the Instituto Humboldt. Role: Principal Investigator.
* Decoding soundscapes for biodiversity monitoring: the study case of tropical dry forest. (2019-2020). Develop tools and workflows to analyze audio recordings and assess changes on animal diversity related to the transformation and degradation of tropical dry forest. Funded by MinCiencias and the Humboldt Institute. Role: Postdoctoral researcher.
* [Ecoacoustics Colombian Network](https://redecoacustica.org/) (REC, by its acronym in Spanish). Strengthen the interdisciplinary network of researchers and collaborators committed to exploring the intersection between acoustics and ecology, amplifying knowledge about the relationship between sound and the natural environment. Role: Coordinator.
